## The Details

Hello! My name is Kraaven. I made a programming language called Birch. This extension provides some syntax highlighting that makes Birch Language a little easier to run.

## Installation

To use the language. you can find the link to the Github [here](https://github.com/Kraaven/ProjectBirch). The releases page will provide you with the interpreter.

## Documentation

The Github proves to be effective with providing documentation for the language. Otherwise, you can run

```
.main{
    syscall : describe;
}
```

~ to print documentation during runtime.

## Conclusion

Good Luck and have fun!
